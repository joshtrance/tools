Two functions that check a string's 
/contents to see whether it is a valid integer
/and/or a valid floating point number. The 
/functions will return true if valid,
/and false if invalid. Disqualifying factors
/include empty strings, spaces in between digits,
/decimal places in ints, alphas, and recursion of
/polarity signs.
